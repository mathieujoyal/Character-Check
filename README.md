# Character-Check

First things first, I had to imagine how to make this idea take shape.


## The Calculator

This is a Calculator for D&D 5th edition that uses the most populator character stats building logic known as: Point buy.
The way it works is that all 6 "Ability", "attributes" or "stats" (strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and
charisma"), start at a base of 8 and cannot be lowered more than that nor can it be increased to more than 15 when creating a
character. (This is subject to change depending on who the user is playing with but since this is a majorly accepted rule in 
the universe of Dungeons and dragons (D&D), this website uses that restriction.) The users can then add or subtract points to
any attribute they wish to increase/decrease as they wish until they have spent all 27 of their starting points. (Again, this
rule is  subject to change but 27 is the normally accepted number as rules stand but as i mentionned, depending on who the 
user is playing with. This website sticks to the most commonly accepted rules.) If an attribute/stat is at 13 and is increased
to 14 or if it is at 14 and increased to 15, then the remaining points is lowered by 2 instead of 1. Revesersably, if it is at
15  and it is decreased to 14 or if it is at 14 and is decreased to 13, then the remaining points will go up by 2 instead of 1.

The Ability Modifier is a very important number to keep in mind when creating a character. Most people rely on THAT specific
Number/concept in focus and base their entire point spending around it. At the base of 8, the modifier is -1. The modifier 
then becomes 0 when the stat is at 10, it becomes +1 when it reaches 12, +2 when it reaches 14, at 16 it is +3, ect..
This number influences the majority of the character sheet's values and how the game is then played for this user.

It takes into concideration a number of variables. The starting number of 8 ( that base rule i was talking about again), then adds whatever bonus are granted by the selected race ( and sometimes subrace ) and then finally add the number of points added by the user using the point buy system. It then calculates that Ability modifer that i mentioned earlier. It is important to note that the bonus points obtained from your race are added at the end and do not influence the "price" of the point buy system. They do influence the end result of the modifer nonetheless.
